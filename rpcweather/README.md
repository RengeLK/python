# rpcweather/DisWeather
A local Python script that takes the current weather in your area and displays it on your Discord profile with RPC! Now with extra.py if you need just some info in your terminal!!

You will need a Discord app and OpenWeatherMap API key (can be free) for this. Just put those into example.env -> .env and you're good to go!
